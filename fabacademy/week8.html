        This week we had a lecture on Embedded Programming. Here are some of my notes:

        <br></br>
<ul>

        <li> Mircocontroller -> mostly single-purpose, programmable
        <li> Microprocessors -> able to run OS, more multi-pupose, programmable.
  </ul>

  I didn't have too much time to come up with ideas for this project, since I have been busy preparing for Design Dialogues coming up in a few weeks and I've focused on trying to complete final design interventions.

        <br></br>
  For this week's assignment, we had to use your programmer (HUZZAH32, ESP32 Feather) to program a circuit with a led and a button to do something. The circuit board, could be done as a shield, breadboard or vinyl cutter

        <br></br>
        I worked on the project after the Easter holidays once I had more time on my hands. I tried to integrate this assignment with my project and interests, so I browsed YouTube until I found something I was interested in.

        I couldn't find the material needed to make this project, so instead I am including the content from my third fabacademy challenge. The full documentation can be found <a href="https://github.com/jose-hirmas/fab_challenge_3/blob/main/README.md">here</a>.
        <br></br>


        For this challenge, we are exploring how sound affects humans decisions.
        <br></br>

Based on design ethics, we started discussing about the non-neutrality of design, boundaries between technology and design, how design choices influence the functionality of society and the re-creation of reality.
<br></br>

Our common areas of interest are music, games, communication, interactive design and low tech with the purpose of seeking new ways of relationship between humans and non-humans. Through this, we are developing an artifact that allows human interaction, guided by different sounds, creating a final output of sound-paintings. The human interaction (input) is about drawing and being guided by the sounds. The final output is the drawing itself.
<br></br>

This is the general sketch of our idea:
<br></br>

        <img src="../images/fabacademy/week8/project_diagram2.png" alt="sketch" style="width:100%">

        <br></br>

Build of materials
<ul>
<li>15 x 24 cm
<li>4mm transparent acrylic panel
<li>20 x 30 cm copper vinyl cut sticker
<li>9 cables connecting board to Arduino/Playtronica
<li>ESP32
<li>Playtronica
<li>Scrap MDF wood

  <br></br>

First off, we started prototyping a with scrap copper stickers and the ESP32 (left), then we moved on to an acrylic plaque with the design we wanted (right).

  <br></br>

  <br></br>
This is the code we wrote in arduino to make the conductive copper make sounds, using Pure data (left). All the files are on the fabchallenge repo, in the <a href="https://github.com/jose-hirmas/fab_challenge_3/tree/main/FILES"> files folder</a>.
