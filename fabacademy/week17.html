        Week 16 - Applications & Implications
  <br></br>
        MDEF x Akasha Hub: Sensing Ecologies (Eorking Title)




        <br></br>
        <i>Concept Summary</i>

          <br></br>
        Natural and technological ecosystems are closely related, however counter-intuitive it might seem at first. Investigating these overlapping areas through our senses, we venture in hybrid worlds of sounds, visuals and haptics. Between self-mutating algorithms and recursive patterns in nature, we draw similarities and aim to provoke questions about a more sustainable and tangible view of technology.
  <br></br>

  <i>   Exhibits</i>
  <br></br>

  What will it do?

  <br></br>

    [1]  VJ Area: Sensing Spaces (Working Title)

      <br></br>

        TL;DR: A live and interactive audiovisual installation on the main screen featuring a set of biomaterials and plants as physical triggers.

        <br></br>


        Audiovisuals related to nature + algorithms are generated by participants touching buttons, like a VJ/DJ set. There will be a panel with various unconventional buttons, including plants, biomaterials and other artifacts related to the theme. Various visuals and sounds will be triggered at the same time, overlaying on top of each other depending on the buttons chosen.
  <br></br>

    [2] Fractals at different scales


        <br></br>

        TL;DR: A video loop exploring recursive forms in nature and mathematics.

        <br></br>


        This project investigates how fractals and other mathematical patterns appear both in the natural and digital world. It would be a video which morphes a mix of algorithmically created fractals & “natural” fractals without any sound and interactions. The loop would be a few minutes long and displayed on a screen.
        <br></br>


      [3] Sonic Ecologies

        <br></br>

        TL;DR: A interactive experiment distributed across six small stations, inviting participants to shape clay from Collserola park inspired by audio recordings taken there. These clay artefacts will give sonic feedback while being touched.


        <br></br>

        Exploring the Relation between sound, technology, nature and the physical world.


        <br></br>

        When was the last time that you played with mud? Why are objects designed to last forever? Why have we lost our connection with nature? What is the relationship with sound and our physical world?


        <br></br>

        These are some of the questions that will be explored with this intervention. Sonic Ecologies is a series of specific designed interventions that will be happening in the city of Barcelona and its natural surroundings, Ending with MDEFEST trail road in the natural park.

        <br></br>

        The intervention is designed to work as a cycle, with human intervention opening and closing the loop, and Its divided in x stages.

        <br></br>

        Stage 1: Recollect the Clay from Collserola Park, or el Garraf. These two are natural parks in the surroundings of Barcelona that in some areas, have Clay soil that is used for crafts and fabrication. During the recollection of clay, the natural sounds of the place will be recorded to use them for the exposition.
        <br></br>


        Stage 2(AKASHA): The Clay will be installed in different metallic and conductive totems, these totems will be connected to an electronic system that will be throwing sound signals when the clay is touched, so it will be modeled in a collaborative way by people that will be participating in the expo. Its expected that the resulting shape will be abstract like sculptures.

        <br></br>

        Stage 3: For the final act, there will be a hike organized to Collserola park, where every participant will take a piece of the clay that was made by different people the day before. The pieces of clay will be seted up for a music performance that will be played there. After the performance, all of the clay pieces will be returned to the park as little sculptures, as nendo dango seeds, or as traces of human intervention. So with that approach the object will have its own natural cycle, where it was taken, used and returned where it belongs.

    [4] Interactive Particles (interactive simulation instances)

        <br></br>

        TL;DR: A live and interactive visual installation inviting participants to move particles through motion inputs.
        <br></br>

        Gathering motion data input from either Kinect (movement, postures) or Leap Motion (hands, gestures), we can let visitors interact with a particle simulation running in Touchdesigner, or Processing. The particles will move according to natural laws, akin to snowflakes, water, mircoorganisms or smoke (tbd).

        <br></br>




What will you design?

<br></br>

We will design the visuals using Touchdesigner, Processing and Resolume. We will need to fabricate a pannel with buttons that can be used to control the audiovisuals in the VJ space. Here is a preliminary sketch of what that could look like.

<br></br>



What materials and components will be used?

<br></br>


Plywood/MDF, Arduino, many cables, conductive copper stickers, servo motors.
<br></br>


Where will it come from?

<br></br>

How much will they cost?
<br></br>


What parts and systems will be made?

<br></br>

What processes will be used?

<br></br>

What questions need to be answered?

<br></br>

How will it be evaluated?
<br></br>



Who’s done what beforehand?
