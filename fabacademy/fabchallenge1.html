Our first Fabacademy challenge! I teamed up with Marina and Roberto to work on this challenge.

<br></br>

Our task was to <i>Design and make "something" that can help the process of designing / creating / thinking / collaborating with others.</i>
<br></br>

The full documentation of the project can be found on our <a href="https://roberto-broce.github.io/fabchallenge/">repository</a>. On this page, I will summarize the process, focusing on my perspective.
<br></br>

Before doing anything with CAD software, I decided to sketch out my design on my iPad to make sure I had the correct vision. This is what I came up with:
<br></br>

<br></br>

That being done, it was time to start modeling a box in Fusion, and learn the basics from a tutorial on how to model a simple box. Once I tackled that, I decided to customize it and turn it into a wine box, adding handles, engravings, bending parts and the correct measurements.
<br></br>

Here are the details of the model:

Once my model and sketches were complete, I booked a slot at the laser cutter, and learned how to format everything from Anna, then subsequently taught Chris how to do the same. There was a long bottleneck because everybody was slightly late, so I decided to put Chris’ and my designs together.

On my first iteration on Friday, the structure worked well, but I still encountered problems. The engraving was not being detected by Rhino for some reason, despite using multiple different file formats. The holes for the clicking of the various parts were not big enough; I was told the thickness was 2.3mm, not 2.5mm but I ended up sanding it off a bit and it worked fine. Finally, the bending part at the top was not flexible enough. There was no time to solve these problems on the same day, given all the people waiting in line.
<br></br>

I solved all the aforementioned problems in Fusion 360 over the weekend and was determined to come home with a working box. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The engraving worked, the cuts were improved and the bending was more precise. However, the laser did not cut through the MDF material. I believe that this was due to the fact that Santi, who was helping me with the settings, refocused the laser in the middle of the material, yet kept the same settings as Gerda who was before me. Since there may have been a variation in material size at the beginning and/or the lens was getting progressively dirty, this resulted in an imprecise cut. I left IAAC feeling frustrated and unaccomplished after all this work.

If I’m being honest, I am overwhelmed by the amount of assignments we are dealing with right now. It feels like before I even have the time to cross out my to-do list, I already have more to-dos added and I am constantly trying to catch up. I am currently finishing up the documentation of the weekly assignment yet we have already started with the fabacademy monthly challenge and expected to complete it by the end of the week, in addition to many other projects for other lessons.
<br></br>

 I don’t understand how we are having submissions to do every single week with the addition of monthly projects, long term assignments, documenting everything, and updating our website regularly. It’s too much for me to handle right now, and I know I am not the only one who feels like this.
 <br></br>

Despite these sentiments, I am determined to improve the design and make the final piece by next week. I liked my idea and the teased output from Tuesday’s cutting session seemed to be really nice. If I finally manage to cut it out well, I think it will turn out to be a beautiful piece.
