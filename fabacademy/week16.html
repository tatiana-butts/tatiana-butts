        Week 16 - Wildcard Week

        <br></br>


Wild Card Week was an opportunity for us to explore several different techniques in one day, based on whatever we preferred. This weekâ€™s session was fun, entertaining and very open ended to what we wanted to do. We got the chance to explore alternative fabrication techniques.
<br></br>

The first part of the class was based on the Robotic Arm. We learnt about its 6-axis manipulator which Edu compared to our own arms. It has a wide range of motion, much more than a CNC, laser of even 3D printer. We also learned about the notions of replicability, and the tiniest margins of eror which could cause the product to not be of desired result, after thousands of times.
<br></br>
There were some differences to what we were used to: modeling for the robotic arm is different than modeling for any other fabrication method because it works with planes instead of points. The robot works in the most efficient way to get to from point A to B.

<br></br>

In the second part of the class, we worked with composites. We got a demonstration on how to use burlap with epoxy resin to make a skateboard deck. In order to create a mould, the vacuum press was used to compress each layer of the burlap which was carefully placed on top of the other and then brushed with resin.  We also learned about all the different kinds of resins we could use: from bio-resins, to petroleum based resins. Although bio-resins are bio based and do not require fossil fuels, they have a similar impact as non-bio because they are so hard to degrade, recycle or dispose of.

<br></br>

My project:

<br></br>

I really wanted to go to the robotic arm session, but unfortunately it was organised the day that Chris and I had an important meeting with Akasha hub, where we ended up discussing our final project and confirming that it could be displayed there. Although we were sad to miss the session, it was an opportunity we simply could not refuse.
<br></br>

Instead, we teamed up to work on this:
