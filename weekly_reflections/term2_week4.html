      On Monday afternoon we had a very interesting Future talk by Sergio Uruena about how we shape society through innovation and how we must use responsibility when creating and using technologies. I resonated with a lot of what he was saying, so I took many notes. One of my favourite quotes is this one:

        <br></br>

<i>“Any form of future-making is also the equivalent of future-taking”</i>

        <br></br>

After the class, I teamed up with Marina and Paula to experiment with waste and biomaterials for our submission due at the end of the week. You can find the full documentation of that process <a href=”https://tatiana-butts.github.io/tatiana-butts/assignments/remixing_materials2.html”>here</a>.

On Tuesday, we had the Design Studio class in Elisava with Oscar and Mariana. We discussed the contents of the talk from the previous day, and questioned Material Semiotics and how our deepest desires are reflected in the technologies we build and use.

        <br></br>

 Mariana provided us with a very mind-opening “psychoanalysis” on NFTs. She dove deeper into the meanings behind NFTs, why they have been booming recently and the primal roots they have.

Then, we each presented our design interventions. It was very interesting to hear what other groups have to say, especially since I had no idea what the people outside my group bubble were up to.

<br></br>

Following that, we engaged in exercises aimed to explore new dimensions of responsibility within our projects. We worked on our multiscalar design space again in search for new design opportunities, reflecting on what should stay and what we can leave behind.

On Wednesday, we learned about laser cutting and making parametric designs. I was struggling to learn both of these skills at once, but it was satisfying to see the results slowly appear. Honestly, this week I have been so overwhelmed with the amount of work I needed to do. With the weekly reflections, fabacademy challenges, design interventions, assignments

<br></br>

It feels like before I even have the time to cross out my to-do list, I already have more to-dos added and I am constantly trying to catch up. I don’t understand how we are having submissions to do every single week with the addition of monthly projects, long term assignments, documenting everything, and updating our website regularly. It’s too much for me to handle right now.

<br></br>

All that aside, if you want to take a look at my weekly Fabacademy assignment, you can find it <a href=”../fabacademy/week3>here</a>.
