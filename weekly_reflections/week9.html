    <h3>WEEK 9</h3>
    <p>Extended Intelligences II / Design Intervention</p>

      This week started with a holiday that I didn’t use as a holiday, but rather an opportunity for my Design intervention group to host our Biomaterials workshop. You can read all the details about it <a href="../assignments/design_intervention.html">here.</a>

<br></br>

      Following the days of the workshop, Marina, Pippa and I had assigned each other various tasks to complete by Monday the 13th, when we would have our design Studio class with Oscar, knowing that this was when we would have to present a lot of our work. I had to contact the participants, asking them for feedback, and edit all the photos/videos so that we could showcase that material.

<br></br>

      I began by creating a “Video Frame” in our Miro board, in which I would dump all of my micro to-dos. I created a section on the 3 different videos we needed, the storytelling framing behind them and the pipeline of everything that had to be done in order to complete them in time. Here is some of the work surrounding the videos:

      I wanted to find a way to tell a logical story which the viewers could follow along easily, from the very beginning of the process up until the workshop results.

      In parallel to this, we had our last classes about Extended Intelligences which were a continuation of last week’s seminars. These seemed to be more theoretical, trying to explore the frameworks, ethics and boundaries surrounding the topic of AI. Some interesting observations arose, which you will be able to see when I upload my notes from the seminar onto the website, here. (give me a few days to make them look pretty though)

      <br></br>

      In addition to these classes, we had two presentations for those seminars we had to deliver on Friday. It was definitely a lot to juggle, and I feel like my project bucket has been drained of all of its magic creative water. Something which I am noticing is that I feel less satisfied with the projects I come up with when they yield no tangible results. When they are only theoretical (which these both were) I feel as though my efforts were not useful, because the project is only thoughts turned to words on a presentation.

      <br></br>

      I’m hoping that the future projects I will work on will be not only more practical & hands-on, but also less frequent and short-deadlined. Even though everybody in the class wants to make things they are proud of, it is very hard to do so when we are constrained to 3 days of brainstorming work. This may be why I was so proud of the Biomaterials workshop on Monday, despite not being entirely sure that it is the topic I wish to pursue in term 2.

      <br></br>

      Regardless of this, here are the two Extended Intelligences presentations, which I still think are pretty interesting ideas.

      Other than that, there is not much to say, because most of my week has revolved around the aftermath of the Design Intervention Workshop, mainly on the video editing, write-ups and miro board editing, all with the goal of understanding how to best share the experience during the Design Dialogues at the end of the term.
