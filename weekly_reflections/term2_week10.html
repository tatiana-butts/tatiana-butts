           In a city inundated with light pollution, is it possible to restore the magical feeling we once had when looking up at the sky? We have been gazing at the stars for centuries, and connecting the constellations inevitably connects us as well. What happens when we can no longer see the stars?
           <br></br>

           This project is a collaboration between Tatiana Butts and Christian Ernst, who each worked on visual and audio respectively. The audio music was produced and mixed in Ableton Live, using Magenta (based on Tensorflow’s machine-learning framework), most of the melodies were generated with the help of algorithms. Based on these, instruments and effect chains were built to ‘perform’ the notes and modulate their parameters. The video was then created using sound reactive particles in TouchDesigner and animations + visual effects After Effects.
           <br></br>

           On Wednesday March 23rd, Tatiana and Chris from the Master in Design for Emergent Futures projected Artificial Constellations, for the first time on the IAAC rooftop.

On Wednesday 23rd of March was the day of my collaborative intervention with Chris. Just the week before we were unsure if we could manage all the tasks that had to be completed before the final day, and we almost postponed the entire event. I am glad that I pushed through and motivated us to keep working and get it all done in time.

<br></br>

          I spent the weekend + Monday finishing up the video, exporting the sound reactive particles from TouchDesigner into After Effects and doing the video editing there, alongside animations, music sync and special effects. I got the video done by Monday afternoon so that we could do a final test in the evening with the complete video. Both Chris and I were shocked and amazed at how beautiful the projection actually was. We couldn’t have imagined it being better. We were worried about the light, the brightness of the projection, the weather, the sound etc. but none of that turned out to be a problem.

          I remember that we viewed the entire video with the wind tugging at the screen, making the experience more immersive because the artificial stars blended in with reality. Just as the final credits finished being displayed, a giant gust of wind hit the sheet and ripped off 2 of the 4 corners in a grandiose cinematic ending. Chris and I laughed because it felt so perfectly planned.

          The only thing we could hope for was good weather on Wednesday…
          <br></br>

          On Wednesday, it was raining all morning. I came to school angry and sad that we may have had to cancel the event. Instead, in the afternoon, the sun came seemingly out of nowhere and dried up the streets and the roof. I cheered up.

          At 19.00, we began to set up everything.
          <br></br>
          We got help from our partners to set up the screen, decorate with lights, position the benches, perfect the projection, take photos and light up the candles. We fixed the screen down with some  bricks to keep it from moving around too much.
          <br></br>

          We also an audio test and mic check. Time passed by so quickly that people were already making their way up.

          We started presenting at 20.15, giving a brief introduction of the project, our ideas behind it and the work each of us contributed. I was weirdly nervous the entire time I spoke. Then, we were ready to play the video, except the audio was no longer functioning. We spent the next 5 minutes trying to figure out what went wrong, reconnecting and disconnecting cables, then switching on and off all the buttons. Those five minutes felt like an hour. Then comes Juaquin with his magic touch and fixes everything. Finally time for the projection to start.

          <br></br>

          I was happy and excited and nervous all at once. It felt like the build up was so long for this very moment and finally we had an audience in front of our work. Not only were there people from MDEF, but also other masters at IAAC and a few external guests. We were happy to have gotten a bigger variety of people.
          <br></br>

          After the video was done, people clapped and we returned to the front and spoke again. We told everybody about the activity we had planned: mapping our own constellations and values with chalk and candles. I think it was a great idea to have this at the end of the event, because it felt so much more conclusive this way. Given that the video was less than 5 minutes long, it may have felt too short without this collaborative activity at the end.

          The result was a mix of beautiful drawings, inside jokes and cats. I laughed as I thought about ancient culture mapping taurus and capricorns whereas nowadays we value domestic animals like cats and dogs more. Even though the activity was light and fun, it really did show values and trends from the modern world.
          Here are some photos:
          <br></br>

          Overall, I was super happy after this event. Part of me was sad that it was over and wanted to play the video again and again because there was so much work behind such a short exhibition. It was very fulfilling to have my vision come true and have all of it come together well. Many told us that it was a great break from working on final projects and fabacademy challenges. Not only do I think it was beautiful to see, but the results were inspiring too: people were happy, engaged, playful and curious.
