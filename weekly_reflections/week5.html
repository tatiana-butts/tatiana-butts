    <h3>WEEK 5</h3>
    <p>Tech Beyond the Myth</p>


<h2> <br>This week we engaged in two types of group activities revolving around understanding technology better. The first one focused on demystifying the “black box” we often see in the hardware side of technology. Each group had to pull apart an electric appliance and examine the contents of it, trying to understand how each feature worked and how easy it would be to repair. There was a tv, a roomba, an induction stove, an iMac and a macbook. My group got the 2003 apple Macbook. These were the findings of our technological dissection:

<i>What does it do?</i>
<br></br>

<br>The Macbook is a portable electronic device that can store large amounts of information and be given sets of instructions to organize and change it very quickly. It can also access the internet via wifi or cable.</br>


<div class="grid">
  <div class="header">
  <br></br>
  <i>How does it work?</i>
  <br></br>
  </div>

  <div class="sidebar">
    <img src=../images/week5/components.jpeg>
  </div>

  <div class="content">
  <ul>
    <li> the chargeable battery provides power</li>
    <li>the CPU provides computational power</li>
    <li>the GPU processes the graphics</li>
    <li>the RAM stores the short-term data and ensures speed</li>
    <li>the hard drive stores data indefinitely</li>
    <li>the motherboard connects everything together and runs the operation system</li>
    <li>the wifi cards and telecommunication chip provide access to the internet wireless and with a cable</li>
    <li>the two fans cool the system down</li>
    <li>the two speakers provide audio </li>
  </ul>
</div>
</div>

<br></br>
<i>How is it built?</i>
<br></br>
  The body is made out of aluminium and the inner structure has a magnesium coating. Screws keep the components together and the cables connect the components to each other. We assume that part of the construction was automated and the small details had human intervention.


<br></br>

  </div>

  <div class="content">
    <br></br>
    <i>Why did it fail, or it wasn't used anymore?</i>
    <br></br>
    We believe that one of the two fans was damaged, possibly leading the CPU to overheat and melt.
    We also think the whole laptop is not usable anymore due to its outdated components.
    <br></br>

<div class="margin-alignment">
  As you can see, there seems to be some damage on the fan + cpu.

<h2>
  <br></br>
  <i>Opening the laptop</i>
  <br></br>
  <ol>
    <li>Unscrew the back to find the battery (15inch, rechargeable battery, Li-ion, no mercury, 10.8V)</li>
    <li>Unscrew the lid of the RAM (produced by Samsung in Korea 0351)</li>
    <li>Find and eject 2 RAM memory cards (each card had 256MB)</li>
    <li>Remove all screws visible on exterior</li>
    <li>At this point, the safety check popped out, voiding the warranty.</li>
  </ol>

<br></br>
Everything beyond these simple steps would void the warranty, meaning that Apple would no longer take responsibility to fix the product.

  <i>Conclusions</i>
  <br></br>

  Overall, it was a lot of fun to disassemble the laptop and examine all the parts to see how they work and which ones are connected.


  <br></br>
  <i>What did we learn?</i>
  <br></br>

  The parts were mostly made and assembled in Asia
  There were so many different parts in a single laptop
  The warranty was void almost immediately. Nowadays you wouldn't even be able to open new macbooks so easily.
<br></br>

  <i>What surprised us?</i>
  <ul>
  <li>what a large amount of screws there were (about 100)</li>
  <li>how many countries were involved in the production</li>
  <li>many of the components inside the macbook were not produced by Apple, but instead companies like Samsung, Intel and Motorola</li>
  <li>how much the technology changed in such a short time</li>
  <li>how precise the parts were integrated and connected to each other</li>
  <li>how difficult it was to disassemble it - it’s like they don't want us on the inside.</li>

<h3>PART 2</h3>

<br></br>
<h2>

The second activity involved data. The day after taking apart hardware and examining it carefully, we switched into different groups again, this time trying to define a project involving data. We had to map out an objective, a hypothesis and questions whose answers would be found in the data we would gather. Surprisingly, we found many “black boxes” in this activity too, even though that may not have been the initial goal of it. Here is the process of our data project:
<br></br>
<h2>

<h3>
  <div class="margin-alignment">Objective &rarr; Hypothesis &rarr; Data gathering</h3>
<div>

<h2>
<u>Objective:</u> We want to eat more locally produced food.
<br></br>
<u>Hypothesis:</u> the food from the vending machine does not come from local sources.
<br></br>
<u>Question:</u> Where does the food from the vending machine come from?
<br></br>
<br></br>

<i>Ideas on data gathering:</i>
<br></br>
<div class="margin-alignment">
  <h4>Camera</h4>

<ul>
<li>Put a camera next to vending machine and detect which brands are being bought</li>
<li>Use it to detect whether people are interested in knowing where the products are actually coming from.</li>
<li>Engage people to ask whether they can understand if foods are produced locally from the label itself</li>
<li>Ask people to take photos of the serial number each time they buy something (this way we don’t have to empty out the vending machine)</li>
</ul>


  <h4>Web scraping</h4>

<ul>
<li>understand where the ingredients are coming from through online sites</li>
</ul>


 <h4>GPS</h4>

 <ul>
<li>Use it to make a map of where products are coming from
</ul>
</div>

<br></br>
<h2>
In the end we voted for the webscraping tool. Here is how we used it in our research.

Web scraping: Manually and Automated through python
</div>
</div>

<br></br>
We found websites that have databases about food production, import and export

<ul>
<li> Oec<br></br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Y5FGo0C.png" style=width:60%></li>

<li>ITC Trade Map<br></br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Lq3daRJ.png"style=width:60%></li>
</ul>

All database sources are written below.
<br></br>

<i>How do you combine the tool provided with your creativity to prove your hypothesis? How long did you capture data?</i>

<br></br>

We decided which categories of food brands and ingredients to research, basing ourselves on the available resources within IAAC's specific vending machine. We started small, then built up until we reached a global scale of interconnected supply chains.
<br></br>


<i>List all the materials needed, including those given to you, those you source or even things you built yourself.</i>
<br></br>

Techniques used:
<ul>
<li>Manual “web scraping”
<li>Automated web scraping
<li>Scanning products through Open Food Facts app
<li>Researching through food brand website
</ul>

Resources used:
<ul>
<li>delikia.es
<li>www.girofibra.com/
<li>es.openfoodfacts.org
<li>oec.world
<li>trademap.org
<li>Oscar ❤️
</ul>


<i>Explain the setup process.</i>
<br></br>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/mVYg1IX.jpg" style=width:100%></li>
<br></br>
We looked at the products in the vending machine and tried to gather information about each one, using different websites.


<br></br>

<i>Describe the raw data you collected by posting a sample i.e. a picture, a screen capture, etc.</i>
<br></br>

<br></br>

<p>Excel sheets generated from open food facts, Map from open food facts, Excel sheets generated from ITC trade map and Interactive map from OEC</p>

<br></br>

Thanks to all of these sources, we managed to cross reference the information which we obtained. We noticed many differences from one resource to the other.
<br></br>


<i>Post at least two images of a chart, a screen-shoot of your data, that you used to prove if your hypothesis is false.</i>
<br></br>
We were surprised to see that the Natwins cookies claimed their product was "local". However, they do not define what exactly local means, and later state that their ingredients come from the "Mediterranean".
<br></br>
The mediterranean area includes 21 countries, which means that the food origins are almost untraceable (Albania, Algeria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Cyprus, Egypt, France, Greece, Israel, Italy, Lebanon, Libya, Malta, Monaco, Montenegro, Morocco, Slovenia, Spain, Syria, Tunisia, and Turkey)
<br></br>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/tHzQrou.png"style=width:80%>
<br></br>

<i>Web scraping v/s Open APIs</i>
<br></br>

Sometimes it might be beneficial to see if there is an open API to access a database instead of going for web scraping the frontend data right away. In the case of Openfoodfacts.com, they offered an open and <a href="https://wiki.openfoodfacts.org/API">very well-documented API</a>, offering various export formats. This allowed us to easily download and analyze the complete dataset for the product category of 'sandwiches'. This was made possible thanks to all the data being covered by the <a href="https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/">Open Data Commons</a>.
<br></br>

<i>Last step</i>
<br></br>

<div class="grid">
  <div class="sidebar">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ob2C5H9.gif"style=width:70%>

</div>
<div class="content">
  We decided to buy a sandwich from the vending machine and trace the possible origins of the main ingredients, using OEC’s data concerning Spain’s imported products.
  The unit of measurement was the value of the product in USD$ and not in tonnes.
  <br></br>
  The primary ingredients of the sandwich were:
  <ul>
    <li>wheat
    <li>pig meat
    <li>cheese
    <li>nuts
    <li>eggs
    <li>yeast
    <li>olive oil
  </ul>
  And these were the primary imports in Spain:

</div>
<br></br>

<iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/l8zLsvefHdc7Z2uIyi" width="480" height="300" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe>
</div>

<br></br>
Of course, this only displays the probability of where each component originated <i>if</i> they were imported. Yet again, the data available to us was incomplete.
<br></br>
<br></br>

<i>Conclusions</i>
<br></br>

<ul>
  <li>It is very difficult to retrieve information about where food comes and goes,
<li>There is a lack of transparency regarding the movement of goods,
<li>There is no detailed information available to the public about food sources,
<li>Recognising that Web Scraping is an option, but not always the best or more efficient one.
</ul>

We now understand that our expectations were too high: we assumed that a lot of the data regarding food production would be available to the public. Maybe we could re-orient our objective from location to nutrition, because that information is much more available.

<br></br>


<i>Tips: Explain one or more mistakes you've made during that phase? What would you change if you did it again? What if you will have more time?</i>

<br></br>

Defining a more specific target in our hypothesis, would have allowed us to access more relevant information. Also, using a different context (restaurant, grocery store) would have yielded more interesting results.
<br></br>

<i>Solutions</i>
<br></br>
Starting an open conversation on the topic of food origins:
<ul>
<li>How can we re-imagine the vending machine? Can we think of a better, more transparent alternative?
<li>If we could trace all our food, we could create legislation that could regulate and promote a circular economy.
<li>Why don’t we question the transparency of our food system more often? It’s such a basic need.
<li>If we can trace food, how will it change the industry?
<li>Can we accurately track the carbon emissions of our food ? often data is private or hard to find.

<p>Activity conducted by Angel Cho, Chris Ernst, Julia Steketee,  Tatiana Butts, Paula Del Rio and Vikrant Mishra.</p>
---------------------------------------------------

<h2>Overall, this week was jam-packed with different, engaging activities. There is a lot to talk about when it comes to planned obsolescence and data gathering in the tech industry. Something that particularly struck me was when we were talking about our objectives during the data exercise, and Victor mentioned that we are not expected to save the planet in two days, so we should pick topics that interest and engage us, regardless of what the outcome may be. I remember he specifically said:

  <br></br>

  <div class="right-alignment">

<h3>“I know a lot of people who said they were going to save the world and instead they end up rich.”</h3>

<br></br>
And I think that sums up the tech industry.
