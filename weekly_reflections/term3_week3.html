        Chris and I began to work on our final project ideas for MDEFest. We began brainstorming what kind of event we wanted, the themes we could explore and where it could take place. We knew we wanted to do some sort of audiovisual experience again where we could give more control to the people viewing, in the shape of interactive buttons. We questioned what exactly buttons could look like, and if they could represent different topics we've been exploring in the MDEF course over the past nine months.

        On Tuesday, I had a review with Guillem, where I invited  Chris as well to talk about all our ideas. We brought up VJing, Resolume, Processing, OSC protocols and conceptual frameworks. I took notes, which you can find below, but we also decided to create a <a href="https://hackmd.io/@592_YzyWS_SxaHJOH3SSdg/HkwrjvcI9">hackmd</a> to be able to store all of this information.

        In between all of this, we decided to invite Juaco onboard to help us out with the hardware and explore musical magic that lives in his brain. We discussed the project again and gave us a list of things to do.

        Then, on Thursday, we had our second class about DAOs, where Lorenzo Patuzzo was invited to complete the lectures series. I found that the class lacked an establishment of theoretical principles for people to follow well and understand the world of blockchain, NFTs, crypto and DAOs. However, despite this it ended up bringing an amazing collaborative opportunity: Chris and I spoke to Lorenzo about Akasha hub and whether it could be a fitting location for our event.

        <br></br>

        The next day, we went to Akasha hub to speak with Carmen, the event coordinator. We were pleasantly surprised about the immediate welcoming feeling she gave us. Despite not having a clear floor plan, concept or even title, our proposal was received in a very positive and supportive way. Together, we decided to move forward with planning out and showing the installation there, and possible one or two exhibits more. Frankly we were overwhelmed by how nice they were, and wondered where the catch was.

        All the notes from that meeting can be found on the <a href="https://hackmd.io/@592_YzyWS_SxaHJOH3SSdg/HkwrjvcI9">hackmd</a> Chris set up.

        We also considered integrating fractals in nature and at different scales into the event, possibly as a side project. I have been investigating the world of fractals and created a little corner on my Miro board dedicated to videos, tutorials, readings and other resources.

        Over the next few days, each of us will work on our tasks, do research, come up with ideas and investigate the aforementioned technologies before we meet up again and see how to move on.
