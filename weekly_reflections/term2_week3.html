I had a bit of a stressful week. We began having project deadlines and assignments to complete and I felt like I was not going to be able to produce good quality work because I lacked the equipment, facilities and honestly motivation.

<br></br>

I tried to persevere, and not get overwhelmed by all the submissions due, and instead broke big tasks into smaller to-dos, which made it easier to tackle everything.

After the Making sense & Meaning seminar on Tuesday, I had a wonderful talk both with Kate and Guillem, where we discussed my ideas, projects and doubts. Here are the notes I took during our reviews:

On Wednesday we had our second fabacademy lesson and discussed 2D and 3D softwares. You can find a full recap of that lesson <a href="../fabacademy/week2.html">here</a>.
<br></br>

Thursday we had another day of remixing materials, where we assisted presentations by two women working with biomaterials, especially in the Poblenou communities. I joined Marina and Paula’s group and video called them to discuss our homework. The full documentation of the course is <a href="../assignments/remixing_materials2.html">here</a> for Laura Freixa’s part of the lessons, and <a href="../assignments/remixing_materials1.html">here</a> for Lara Campos’ part.
<br></br>

For the rest of the week, I worked on assignments and design interventions. Although I am working on my initial “Artificial Stars” idea with Chris, since we were both quarantining and I didn’t have access to my strong computer, we decided not to stress out about delivering the results by next week, and instead work on it long term with better results.
<br></br>

In the meanwhile, I tried to do what I could in my current circumstances and developed a quarantine check-in miro board as my substitute design intervention. I made a board for the people I know who are in isolation, and designed it as a way of checking in and stimulating ourselves because I know how monotonous quarantine life can be.

The idea sketches followed by the fully completed board. The entire board can be found <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOQUhjsc=/">here</a>.

Over the weekend I attended the Llums festival and got super inspired by some of the installations I saw. It was my first night out since getting covid, so I was super happy to see my friends again and spend the time looking at beautiful lights. We ended the night with ramen and a walk around the Born streets.
<br></br>

Full documentation of my design intervention and Llum festival can be found in my <a href="../assignments/term2_design_intervention.html">assignments page</a>.
