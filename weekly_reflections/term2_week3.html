        Another week online for me.

I had a bit of a stressful week because we began having project deadlines and assignments to complete and I felt like I was not going to be able to produce good quality work because I lacked the equipment, facilities and honestly motivation. I tried to persevere, and not get overwhelmed by all the submissions due, and instead broke big tasks into smaller to-dos, which made it easier to tackle everything.

After the Making sense & Meaning seminar on Tuesday, I had a wonderful talk both with Kate and Guillem, where we discussed my ideas, projects and doubts. Here are the notes I took during our reviews:
<br></br>

On Wednesday we had our fabacademy day and discussed 2D and 3D softwares. You can find a full recap of that lesson here> LINK
<br></br>

Thursday we had another day of remixing materials, where we assisted presentations by two women working with biomaterials, especially in the Poblenou communities. I joined Marina and Paula’s group and video called them to discuss our homework. The full documentation of that is here> for Laura Freixa’s part of the lessons, and here> for Lara Campos’ part.

For the rest of the week, I worked on assignments and design interventions. Although I am working on my initial “Artificial Stars” idea with Chris, since we were both quarantining and I didn’t have access to my strong computer, we decided not to stress out about delivering the results by next week, and instead work on it long term with better results.
<br></br>

In the meanwhile, I tried to do what I could in my current circumstances and developed a quarantine check-in miro board as my substitute design intervention. I made a board for the people I know who are in isolation, and designed it as a way of checking in and stimulating ourselves because I know how monotonous quarantine life can be.

Over the weekend I attended the Llums festival and got super inspired by some of the installations I saw. It was my first night out since getting covid, so I was super happy to see my friends again and spend the time looking at beautiful lights. We ended the night with ramen and a walk around the Born streets.
