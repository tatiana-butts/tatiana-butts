    <h3>WEEK 11</h3>
    <p>Design Dialogues II</p>



<div class="grid">

         <h6>
           The second round of Design Dialogues. It's always a great way to get feedback from others but also explore other peoples' work.

<br></br>
          I had some very interesting conversations about my projects with people who I wouldn't have normally been able to do so. I quite enjoyed talking to Kristina Andersen, Guillem, Mariana, Ramon Sanguesa and the students from Fabacademy.
           <br></br>
           It's hard to summarise everything in this post, but I will divide it between the Shadows of the Collective and Artificial Constellation
           <br></br>

           <img src="../images/term2_week11/shadows2.jpg" alt="Shadows of the collective" style="width:32.5%">
           <img src="../images/term2_week11/shadows1.jpg" alt="Shadows of the collective" style="width:32.5%">
           <img src="../images/term2_week11/shadows3.jpg" alt="Shadows of the collective" style="width:32.5%">
           <br></br>

          <ul>Shadows of the collective:
            <br></br>

          <li>The power in using the tools, the autonomy and liberty to create your own shadows
          <li>Teaming up with professionals to see if this device could be applied in therapy sessions
          <li>Similar patterns recognised by different individuals: uterus, corals
          <li>Fabacademy student's (sorry i forgot your name) observation about seeing Dinosaur eggs everywhere ever since seeing a sad meme about species exctinction.
          <li>Me realising after WEEKS that I had a mispelling mistake in the poster (it seems like I am unable to write the word "design")
          </ul>

          <br></br>



          <img src="../images/term2_week11/AC1.jpg" alt="Artificial Constellations" style="width:49%">
          <img src="../images/term2_week11/AC2.jpg" alt="Artificial Constellations" style="width:49%">
          <br></br>


          <ul>Artificial Constellations:
            <br></br>
          <li>Collaborating with the Barcelona stars observatory, who also do exhibitions, but "a bit more bland and less controversial than this one" according to Ramon.
          <li>How impactful the "new constellations" were at the end of the video
          <li>The possibility of featuring similar works in spiritual experiences, as suggested by Mariana
          <li>I was greatful to have done the exhibition the week before on the roof with all the participants, because I was able to show the pictures and talk about the constellations we made together
          <li>I liked the setup we had, where everyone had to put on the headphones and stare at the tv, being immersed in a way.
          </ul>
<br></br>

          Now, some photos of other projects which I really liked.
