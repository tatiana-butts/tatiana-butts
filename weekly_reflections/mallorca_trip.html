  When we arrived to the Mallorcan house, it was like heaven:   a garden with lemon trees, flowers and a swing awaited us. 

   Everybody’s face was filled with happiness as they explored the gardens.

   That evening, Tatiana picked an orange straight from one of the trees, and as everyone kept hearing her say: it was the best orange of her life.

   She became known as the orange thief from this point onwards.

   We had dinner at the nearby town Porreres, where some of us walked and others drove past the fields of flowers.

   The way back was beautifully lit by the stars above, which made up for the lack of sidewalk and street lights.

   The next day, we went food shopping with Didac’s car and bought almost 500€ worth of groceries for 22 people.

   After that we showed each other baby pictures and chilled in the backyard. - double

   At five o’clock we had a food tasting session with local fresh Mallorqui ingredients, where we got to experience the food using all of our senses..

   After an abundant breakfast, we went our first hike.

   Mariana guided us through the nature, stopping halfway give us a talk about cognitive ecologies, dreams and subconsciousness.

   We made our way to Banyalbufar, a town which means "founded by the sea”.

   We told countless riddles, trying our best hard to solve them all.

   Along the way, some people were secretly dropping rocks onto other peoples backpacks, without them knowing.

   “You’re only making me stronger!”

   Paula exclaimed. This game contined over the next few days.

   Our next hike lead us to the seaside cliffs.

   There, we met Thomas, who told us to forage, gather and explore the natural environment.

   Some people found interesting like squishy seagrass balls, jellyfish and goat horns, while others had fun climbing up to the cliff's caves.

   On the topmost cave, there was goat poop, which meant that our friendly companions had definitely been there before us.

   We were lucky lucky enough to see the goats up close on our hike back, as well as many different kinds of flowers.

   The orchids were a fan - favourite.

   After gazing at the sea in serenity with in the wind blowing in our face, we napped on the bus ride home.

   Back at the house, we refreshed ourselves with homemade Micheladas made by one of our two local Chileans, José.

   This night was lasagna night, with Pippa & Paula as the main chefs. It may have been the group's favourite dinner.

   On Wednesday we visited the salt farms, took photos at the snowy salt mountains, ate delicious salted caramel ice cream and walked to the sandy beach.

   We all became kids again as the sky cleared up and the sun came out.

   The following day, some of us went to permaculture site where Shaul showed us around his beautiful lush gardens filled with vegetables and flowers.

   We were blown away not only by the beauty, but also the functionality of it all.

   We were lucky enough to get taste of it too, when his wife brought out some colourfed dishes, all seasoned and flavored to perfection.

   We contined the day by presenting our offering to Mallorca in the yoga room.

   Each of us got personal & gave something back to the island which has hosted so well.

   Speaking of the yoga room, we spent a lot of time there stretching our legs and standing on our heads after our daily hikes.

   On Friday, we concluded the week of activities by visiting the town where Mariana lives.

   We went on a botanical tour and Karen showed us all the differt types of plants we can find on a simple walk by the country side, along with all the benefits each one has.

   In the afternoon we got a glimpse into the traditional weaving practices shown to us by women who make bags, hats and sandals out of palm leaves.

   For the final night dinner, we were joined by the professors outside by the barbecue, where we also involved them in a game of Mafia.

   After that, we had Easter Egg hunt in the dark, prepared by Juaco and Roberto.

   Pippa found the most chocolate eggs and Jeremy found a real egg, almost exactly the same size as all the others.

   Overall, it was a great trip which got us to know each other much better and explore the beauty of nature.
