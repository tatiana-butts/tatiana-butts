Magic Machines
</br>
<br>
For the first activity of this course, we had to draw a quick self-portrait on a small piece of paper. Once that was complete,  we then created "Magic Machines" for that version of our self, out of material waste. I was seated at the same table as my post-consumer group and we individually began putting pieces together. Our materials consisted of cardboard, 3D printer waste, scraps from the fablab and trash we found around IAAC.
</br>
<br>
Although we each created different objects, as a group we have found common meanings to our magic machines. The theme could be summarized as Human relationships, whether it be a machine that helps communication between two people (Marina), detect emotions through empathy (Emilio), find new ways of capturing potential friends (Rei), finding your loved ones (Roberto) or framing a moment (Me). Together, we all found ways to create something which interacts with one another, emotionally, intellectually or physically.

<h2>
<br>
What I learned through my magic machine: sometimes it is important to find a way to stop the process of creation. As an artist, I can get wary of beginning a process for fear that the end result won't turn out as planned or that it will take too long to achieve. As a result, there are many moments when I don’t begin the process at all. Slowly, I am beginning to learn the importance of starting just for the sake of starting, without having any expectations of the end result. By doing so, I can practice my passions and get better at this practice regardless of the outcome. Once in a while, I’ll find out that the process is just as fruitful as the result of a magnificent piece of art.
