    <h2>WEEK 1</h2>
    </body>

<paragraph>
<p2> <br>This week could be summed up as being introductory, and rightfully so. Introductions to the students, the staff, the facilities and even the neighbourhood.
</br>
<br>On Monday we met Tomas Diez through zoom, who presented us with some interesting ideas about decentralization and having a strong "why" in our projects. Following that, the students had to talk about their fight by presenting their poster. The poster was a visual representation of any issue, concern, cause, or particular interest we felt strongly about.
</br>
<br>Some of the posters and presentations that struck out the most to me were Nikita’s “Screw Sustainability”, which despite its provocative slogan, shared common ideas with most of the environmental-driven ideologies within our group. I also enjoyed Joaquin’s creative way of illustrating inclusive design through connecting dots, Anna’s cryptic message which highlighted actively thinking for ones’ self and Paula’s intersectional fights.
</br>
<br>My poster was inspired by M.C. Escher’s illustrations I had seen the week before starting the course. At the Maritime museum, I saw a series of posters commissioned by HSBC pointing out the waste crisis with a simple statement: “when you realize, it might be too late.”
