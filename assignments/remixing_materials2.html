        <h3>Remixing Materials II</h3>
        <h2><i>Materials in Context</i></h2>

It was hard for me to complete this exercise in the way which Lara planned us to, because I was still in quarantine in my room, unable to visit the restaurant & shops in person. Therefore, I used Google Maps and tried to located businesses I already knew, but also tried to find something new. I did not only select biomaterials

<br></br>

I am not sure what materials I would like to experiment with specifically, but I do know that I would like to find practical projects that could also be scalable.

<br></br>

Here is the exercise sheet that Laura asked us to fill in:

<br></br>





On Thursday, I joined Paula & Marina’s group through a Whatsapp call whilst they were in class. We shared our Poblenou waste maps and exchanged ideas and resources. The Horchateria and Burger restaurants ended up interesting us the most, so we decided to explore the two main materials those businesses could offer: Chufa (tigernut) and Oil.

Chufas:

​​<br></br>
strong, chewy, malleable, resistant, starchy, blendable

      <img src="../images/assignments/remixing_materials/oil.png" alt="homework" style="width:100%">

Oil:

<br></br>
liquid at room temperature, high boiling point, messy, greasy, water repellant

</div>

— include exercise filled in by Paula & Marina
<br></br>

We evaluated the uses, strengths and downfalls of each material, and how they could be used in application. Some initial ideas that came to mind were making plant based leather out of the tiger nuts and making paint by mixing the oil with waste pigments. We began to do research on both opportunities, and returned to the businesses to collect their materials.

<br></br>

<h2>
Next:
<br></br>

Gather household waste to turn into powder so that we can use as pigments for the paints
<br></br>

Monday, meet up with girls and experiment
<br></br>

Take pictures of experiments
<br></br>

Write short reflection: struggles, pros/cons of materials in practice
<br></br>

Bring materials to class on Thursday
