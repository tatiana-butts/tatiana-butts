ALTERNATIVE PRESENT TEXT:
<br></br>


1. Meaningful entertainment
<br></br>


I do not want to use advanced technologies and make cool vfx for the sake of it, instead attract people through beauty and have them stay for the message. This is actually one of the core reasons why I signed up MDEF, after my frustrations with my meaningless motion graphics and VFX courses.
<br></br>

2. Creative collaboration
<br></br>

Through these interactions and events, I would love creating new communities and collaborations between people who are an identical match of each other but also opposingly complimentary.
<br></br>


3. Engaging ways of learning + introspection
<br></br>

These events would give people new tools to be mindful & present. Mariana often talks about this weak signal: lack of modern day spiritual spaces where people can introspect, learn and share.
<br></br>


4. Interactivity during live events
<br></br>

I like the idea of erasing the boundary between performer and audience, engaging people in topics or artwork through interactive installations.
<br></br>

5. Appreciating nature
<br></br>

Carmen from Akasha hub gave us interesting perspective when we were discussing new media and interactive installations: these are great tools for a generation who may not be used to being in nature or feeling gratitude for it. Reaching them through technology and beauty may be the best way to impact them.
<br></br>

6. Alternative uses to technology
<br></br>

​​Not just social media and addictive UX design. I am sick of “the internet” being online shopping, instagram selfies, pop up newsletter subscriptions, bright red addictive notifications and influencers selling shit. I believe the potential of the internet, technology and digital art to be so much more beyond advertising.
<br></br>


<i>How?</i>
<br></br>

by using technology and art as tools to make us reflect on nature and the various perspectives of sustainability.
<br></br>

<i>Who?</i>
<br></br>

For people interested in technology people not used to appreciating nature
<br></br>

By young creatives newly professionals, together with environmental activists
