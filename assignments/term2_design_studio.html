        <h3>Design Studio Term II</h3>
        <h2><i>A reflection on what happened during Term 1</i></h2>

We began the week by discussing the structure and contents of the upcoming courses with Oscar and Mariana. Then, together we reflected on the past term, and all the lessons we’ve learned. The professors asked us to think about three things we would have done differently, then three takeaways from the whole term. Here are mine:

<i>Three things I have done differently</i>

<ul>
<li>Working with biomaterials is something different than what I am used to.
  <br></br>

I enjoyed learning about the science behind the process, the role of each ingredient, creatively introducing new dyes/textures and perfecting the recipes through time. The tactility of the process was one of the most fun parts for me, given that I do lots of work on the computer.

<li>Working WELL in a group, where everybody is working together, equally hard, and has their own role and voice.
  <br></br>

I have been in many situations where working in a group has been overly complicated, people haven’t done their part or conflicts arose. This was not the case at all with Marina and Pippa, and I believe it shows in our results.
Hosting a workshop (in general) AND despite not being an expert on the topic pushed me out of my comfort zone. I was happy that the workshop ended up being more of an open conversation, rather than a lecture hosted by us. Like this, it felt much more communal, as opposed to a top-down dictation.

<li>Weekly reflections: being forced to submit something each week forced me to be consistent and learn how to use html.

The hard part was not the writing, because I enjoy it and think I do a good job of it. The difficult part was going through our classes each week whilst simultaneously learning how to grasp html. Over the course of the term, I slowly got quicker, better and more confident. Now I can proudly say that I’ve reached an intermediate level of html + css, and I hope to progress throughout the following terms too.

I could classify each of these parts as

<ol>
  <li>New mediums,
  <li>New people,
  <li>New skills.
  </ol>

  The new medium refers to new projects that I am unused to exploring, either because of a lack of time, understanding or resources. Thanks to this program, I now have access to all of those things, which provided a great foundation to learn upon. The notion of new people is quite obvious because enrolling in a new course inevitably brings new connections. In this case, I’m very happy to have met likeminded people with a wide array of skills, who can push or pull me in various directions. And finally, new skills have come forth after term 1, through consistency and dedication.
<br></br>

All of these things that I have done differently show me that it is important to move out of my comfort zone and explore new mediums, new people and new methods. Sometimes it can be tricky to access these areas when not in the right environment, but MDEF certainly has created a wonderful playground for all of these to mingle.
<br></br>
<br></br>



<i>Three key takeaways from Term 1</i>
<br></br>

Not limiting myself to a single topic/path to follow (biomaterials). Coming into the masters, I was very much focused on approaching it with a biomaterials lens. I didn’t know anything about them, but I was fascinated by the implementations and change they could bring. However, I began to feel discouraged in regards to the limits I faced on an individual level, and questioned how useful my DIY biomaterials could be. As of now, I think I will shift away from biomaterials and bring out my creative technology skills, whilst still maintaining my ethics and sustainability mindset.
<br></br>

Learning how to make my own website from scratch in html + css, a skill i have been working on but never got good at until forced to submit things every week. Consistency is important when learning a new, technical skill.

<br></br>

Collaboration with the right people can make or break a project, and when done well it can yield great results. This ties together with what I’ve mentioned in the previous point, when working with a group. I am happy to have worked with Pippa & Marina, but I also believe that we each got our own takeaways from this experience and might continue on separate paths.

<br></br>
<br></br>


<i>What, so what, and now what?</i>
<br></br>

To sum up this reflection, I can confirm that the first term provided me with great experiences. I made connections with a big group of diverse people, I worked on technical projects (Almost Useless Machine, Design Intervention, Bio & Agri Zero...) and also theoretical projects (Machine learning, Tech Beyond the Myth...) . These are all valuable experiences to me.

<br></br>

As for the future, I have considered deepening my knowledge in UX/UI design and advancing my skills in html and web development. I’ve been also taking additional courses in branding and Visual Design to support this, accompanying my coding skills with figma/webflow skills. I like website building and prototyping software, but I also think it crucial to know the code behind it in order to really understand what is going on. Deepening my knowledge in code and widening the coding languages I know is definitely one of the objectives for the upcoming term.

<br></br>

After my talk with Mariana during the first week of classes, I’ve also decided I would like to branch away from Biomaterials and more into interaction design, creative technologies and multimedia installations. She told me to focus on what my drive is and why I enjoy these things so much, in order to comprehend what my motivations are. I already have some answers in mind, but I think one of the first steps will be to dive deeper into these, then continue discussing ideas with my peers.

<br></br>

<h2>

Next steps:
<ul>
<li>Talk to Chris, Angel, Didac and anyone else interested in Tech + Creativity
<li>Research creative studios, events and artists online
<li>Build my current skills
<li>Practice by working on some new projects!
