        <h3>Bio Agri Zero Assignment</h3>
        <p>Hypothetical Designed Organism</p>



<h2>
For the hypothetical designed organism assignment, we had to come up with either a mutant or enzyme that could solve a certain problem we had in mind. The resources we had, other than the knowledge we gained during class, were the iGem website and any scientific papers we wanted to reference.

<br></br>

 Nuria told me to use my creative skills to compliment the task at hand. I chose to tackle the topic of plastic waste by wondering how to break down plastics through enzymes and fungi. I read a few articles and papers on PETase, MHETase and Leaf-branch compost cutinase, which I decided to display in a more "user-friendly" way by creating a poster and translating the information into simpler, every day terms. I could imagine it being a poster or flyer for a group of scientists presenting their work to everyday people at a fair or festival.

   In addition to that, I created an interactive project using TouchDesigner where the user can click on a circle (the enzyme) and control it to erase colourful particles (microplastics). The application for this could be a installation in CCCB or a game for children learning about plastic waste solutions. You can see various colours and effects in the videos below.

<i>Scientific Paper summary</i>
<br></br>

For the scientific paper, I chose to read and summarise a report on Upcycling and Catalytic degradation of plastic wastes. Here is a pdf containing both the summary and paper with my notes.

<h2>
  Some of the contents of the paper (towards the end) were hard to grasp, as the authors used very technical terms to explain complex processes. I did some extra research and found a great video which explained some of those same concepts in a more condensed form, which aided me in understanding the process which was explained in the video.
