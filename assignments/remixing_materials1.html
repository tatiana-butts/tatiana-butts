Since I was quarantining after testing positive, I got sent a lovely biomaterials ingredient bag from Julia. I got the opportunity to test out the same recipes as the class from my home.

I set up my biomaterials space in the kitchen and gathered all the ingredients from my small kit. I decided to only work with the resin, since I had no experience working with it. I divided the resin in two, that way I could make two different recipes.
<br></br>

<br></br>

The resin had specific instructions on it: “grind even before melting” but since I didn’t have a good grinder, I simply smacked it with the back of a spoon while it was still in the bag.

  Then, I placed the resin in a pot with the appropriate amount of alcohol and waited for it to melt, stirring continuously. I did not enjoy the smell, but it looked very cool.

<br></br>

In the meanwhile, I thought about what “filler” to include in the mixture to make it bind well. I found some old, rock hard bread I’ve been keeping for the past few weeks and decided to grate it until it became small breadcrumbs. I added the crumbs to the mixture.

I found some silicone donut moulds which I thought could be an interesting shape to explore with the resin and easy to clean and get the material out without breaking it.

<br></br>

For the first batch, I decided to add a little bit of turmeric to make it orange. For the second batch, I added some chia seeds, blue tea powder and less bread. I was hoping the second batch would be blue, but instead it was a muddy grey, because the pine resin itself was a bit of an earthy green color. I would have preferred to use pink colorant from beetroot juice, but I did not have any in my fridge at that moment.

<br></br>


I placed some parchment paper on top of the donut moulds and squashed it as much as possible, trying to condense the material. I waited until they were completely cool and cleaned up the pot in the meanwhile (it was indeed very messy and hard to get rid of the resin). Lastly, I popped out the two little biomaterial donuts and took pictures of them

<br></br>

Overall, I think the two donuts are very cute, but I would have loved it if they were more vibrant. I don’t know what kind of applications this could have, but perhaps it could replace fake marble, or any products that are made out of traditional-non-biodegradable resin. It was interesting to notice the slight variation in texture after simply adding in some chia seeds, and how beautiful it made it look.
